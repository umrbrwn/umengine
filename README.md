# umEngine

umEngine is a 2D game engine for developing simple browser-based games, originally written in ES6 and later migrated to TypeScript. The motivation is to learn by coding the modules of a game engine i.e., graphics, physics, and input system, scenes.

### Inspiration/Credits

Inspired by Meth-Meth-Method Mario, Cocos2d, Mozilla Developer Network, and W3School. I made Sokoban, and a custom level of Mario as examples, will publish here sometime.

### Todo/Goals

1. Add camera controls, scrolling capability, a simple UI toolkit
2. Model a good game that drives features in this engine
