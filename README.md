# umEngine üïπÔ∏è

Develop simple 2D games to run your web browser using JavaScript/TypeScript with umEngine.

### Inspiration/Credits

Inspired by Meth-Meth-Method Mario, Cocos2d, Mozilla Developer Network, and W3School. I made Sokoban, and a custom level of Mario as examples, will publish here sometime. The goal is to learn game engine internals by developing.
