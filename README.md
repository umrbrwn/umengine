# umEngine üïπÔ∏è

umEngine is a 2D game engine for developing simple browser-based video games, originally written in ES6 and later migrated to TypeScript.

### Inspiration/Credits

Self motivated, and inspired by Meth-Meth-Method Mario, Cocos2d, Mozilla Developer Network, and W3School. I made Sokoban, and a custom level of Mario as examples, will publish here sometime. The goal is to learn game engine internals by developing.
